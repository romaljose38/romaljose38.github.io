                Individual dynamics in organizations aka IDIO, a subject that I was looking forward to attend. Not because I adored the subject in any way, but because I was very curious about the subject. The title of the course added to the curiosity, never in the course structure have I seen a course name, that abstract. Coming from a science background, I was never used to abstract concepts and subjects, I tended to like more concrete subjects such as science, computer etc. Even though I liked reading about abstract concepts, studying them as a course was an absolute nightmare.<br><br> 
Come to reality, compulsory course, not optional, so yeah!! No way around it. Entering the class, the instructor was already there, the environment was welcoming, so off with a good start. Then things became very interesting, we were shown a documentary about 26/11, raising the curiosity to the peak. I mean what does a terrorist operation have to do with organization. Then things slowly started to unfold. It was the behaviour of the employees of Taj hotel that was of interest to us. Initially we were asked to give our answers to a few questions such as what do you expect from a job?, what do you want from a job? Etc. Initially all these questions seemed pointless, but it was later when we realized that Viji was trying to introduce IDIO to us. Why do we do what we do?. What drives us to do work? Is it the fulfilment or meaning that you are getting out of work. Or is it the flow or excellence that you are chasing?. These are the questions that IDIO tries to answer.

                    Personality types
                </span>

            </div>
            <p class="content">
                Enter Myer Briggs Type Indicator aka MBTI. It is a tool used to know more about your personality. People usually use this tool to better understand their own communication style and interpersonal interactions. Understanding your type might enable you to modify your interpersonal style to suit various contexts and target audiences. <br><br> 
So we were asked to do the test to identify our type. What the test does is that, it gives you a series of questions and in the end identifies your personality by answering four questions which are, “where do you get your energy from?”, “what kind of information do you prefer”, “what process do you use to make decisions”, “how do you deal with the world around you”. In the end by assessing you for these four questions MBTI gives you four letters, an E or a J indicating whether you are more of an extrovert or an introvert. A S or an I for Sensing and Intuition. A T or a F for Thinking and Feeling. A J or a P for judging or perceiving.<br><br> 
I gave the test and ended up getting “ENTJ”. I was slightly speculative about that E even though the percentage of extraversion was low in the 10s and the 20s, so tried again and got the same result. Never in my wildest imaginations did I think that I would be extraverted, and I am sure that any of my friends can testify for this.<br><br> 
In the class during the discussion of MBTI ma’am practically picked out a few outliers, like people with a high degree of introversion or a high degree of extraversion. Because just like anything, personality traits will also be normally distributed. Most of the people at and around the peak will have some mix of both extraversion and introversion and not too much of either of them. But the action happens not at the peaks but at the tails. That is where we can actually see the differences between introverts and extroverts. The discussion between introverts and extroverts was rather interesting. Couldn’t help but notice that the extroverts were very cheerful on the stage compared to the introverts. The way extroverts and introverts thought, and therefore functioned, was very different. The former felt a need to break the silence and initiate the conversation in a group and felt uncomfortable otherwise but the latter felt awkward to start such conversations. There is a myth that has to be debunked, extroverts are better than introverts, which is absolutely wrong. Because the only difference between the two is the way in which they get stimulated. Also infact most of the greatest thinkers and inventors are said be enjoy solitude and had a more introverted nature than an extroverted nature. But now the world is in such a way that it caters to the extrovert’s need of constant stimulation, because of which introverts find it hard to function as per their nature. One book suggestion given by ma’am during the lecture was “A whole new mind: Why right brainers will rule the world” by Daniel Pink. The book talks about why right brainers may have an edge over left brainers in this world. The reason being, left brainers are predominantly good at analysing the details, interpreting text etc, but nowadays those skills may not be enough. With the emerging trends and technologies such as automation the need for such skills may get reduced and those who could derive a more bigger picture, those who are more creative may be needed. And this happens to be just the characteristics of the right brainers. Even though AI has developed enough to a point where AI can be “creative” the margin between humans and AI in creative domains still remains the same and will continue to do so atleast in the near future. <br><br> 

Then comes the next set of preferences sensing and intuition. Sensing is when a person tries to comprehend the events around him by using his five senses while intuition is when one tries to make sense of an event using impressions and patterns which he derives from the gathered information. There are fields in which sensing can work well, like in the case of engineering and there are others where intuition works well. <br><br> 

The third preference pair is thinking and feeling. The difference between these two is, when you make a decision, how is it that you arrive at the decision, is it by looking at the facts and thinking objectively or do you bring in emotions and personal concerns to decision making as well.  <br><br> 
The last preference pair is judging vs perceiving. This pair deals with your orientation to the outside world. Those who have a structured and decided lifestyle are said to be more judging and those who are more flexible and adaptable are said to be perceiving. People with a high degree of judging may be perceived by the outer world as more settled and organized whereas those with high degree of perceiving can be perceived as more adaptable and flexible. <br><br> 

As per these four preferences there are 2^4 ie 16 different personality types as per MBTI, and I happen to be an ENTJ, ma’am then went on to explain the characteristics of an environment, which each type may benefit from. This whole exercise made us appreciate the different personalities. It was never the case that one personality is better than others, as a famous quote goes “You can’t judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree”, same is the case with different people. People are unique in themselves and cannot be expected to perform similarly given the same circumstances, we have to understand the differences that differentiate us, and hence act accordingly. Knowing your personality type also helps you to choose a job better suited for your personality so that you can maximize your contribution and value to the organization.<br><br>

                    Playing to your strengths
                </span>

            </div>
            <p class="content">
               One of the assignments given during the course was the reflective best self. It was aimed at finding your strengths and weaknesses by interacting with your former acquaintances. If one is able to identify his/her strength and is able to maximize it, then he is able to offer maximum value to the community. Ma’am introduced the concept of ikigai during the class, ikigai if Japanese for “your life purpose”. It is what inspires you to get out of bed every day. To find ikigai you have to identify four key things, what is it that you love?, what are you good at? What does the world need?, what can you be paid for?. If you are able to answer these four questions, you’ll be able to find your purpose. When you see it, ikigai or any other concept for that matter, enables you to tap into your true self. During the RBS assignment I reached out to some of my friends and family, and I was slightly surprised with few of the responses. To be able to know other’s honest critic about you was a very interesting experience. One of the books suggested was “Managing oneself” by Peter Drucker. In the books Drucker explains why we must learn to manage ourselves. We must position ourselves so that we may best benefit our organisations and communities. And over the course of a 50-year career, we must remain mentally active and interested, which necessitates knowing when and how to shift the type of job we do. It may seem obvious that people obtain success by working in ways that are compatible with their skills and by doing what they are good at. But according to Drucker, few people are aware of their own strengths, let alone use them. He tries to help us gain more self awareness by primarily asking five questions, What are my strengths?, How do I perform?, What are my values?, Where do I belong?, What should my contribution be?. By honestly answering these questions we will be able to figure out our unique selves and position ourselves accordingly. And who knows, may be we’ll be able to climb one or two steps in maslow’s hierarchy as well. <br><br> 
Now what would you do if your work environment does not suit your personality, one solution and the most obvious one is to switch jobs. Well good luck with that. You can’t keep switching jobs just like that right?. So what is the solution?. In comes job crafting. Job crafting refers to the actions taken by employees to reimagine their own jobs in a way that can promote job satisfaction, engagement, resilience, and thriving at work. By efficiently crafting the job according to your personality one can derive more meaning from work by staying in the same role. It benefits both the organization and the employee. For the organization it improves the output and for the employee, well he derives more satisfaction from his work.<br><br> 
One thing about strength based approach still doesn’t digest with me yet. Why should you play to your strengths at all?. Working on your strengths is a good approach. But is it a good approach always?. What if you can’t get paid for your strengths?. Or what if the industry where your strengths can be useful comes with some other features which are not at all favourable for you. Because nothing in the world comes in desired quantums. Everything comes as a package, and like it or not you’ll have to accommodate the rest of the package as well. I think this method may have undermined that aspect.<br><br>

                </span>

            </div>
            <p class="content">
                We had a outbound activity. When the course instructor of IDIO says you have an outbound activity at 7:30 in the morning. I thought we were having the same kind of discussions we have in class but in an outside setting. Turns out I was wrong in every aspect. When we reached SAC by 7:30 a retired military personnel was waiting for us. Which is not something you want to hear at 7:30 in the morning, when you are barely conscious. And again a question that went through my mind multiple times throughout the course, why is this activity in IDIO (Individual dynamics in organizations). I just trusted Viji ma’am hoping this would make sense some time later. “We can’t connect the dots looking forward” ain’t it?.<br><br> 
                We were separated into four groups and each team had to pick a war cry. Then we had to run around 200m, which was absolutely fine. Made us do some crunches and some other basic warmups. Started to regret stopping working out. Then we played a landmine game where each team had to cross a land mine, which was some bricks here and there, by stepping only on the bricks. If we touched the ground, the hypothetical mine would explode. The team had to cross the landmine together. Once the game started all teams were making some mistakes in the rules. So the game was restarted again and again, until nobody was breaking any rules. It was sure that at least one person from one team would have to “die”. But it never reached that point, due to time constraint we had to end it without completing it. It was an interesting experience since each of the team had to cross it together, we had to work as a team, understand the weaknesses and strengths of the team members and plan accordingly. The game taught us to be inclusive and considerate of our peers. The next game that we played was a ball game called Jhu Loo. In Jhu Loo, two teams each were clubbed together and we had to choose two from each team and their eyes were covered. Other team members had to instruct them how to score with the ball given. This game was absolutely hilarious, some were trying to cheat, some team mates were fighting against each other thinking that they are in the opposition team. After this game we were given the option of leaving for breakfast or to stay back for trust fall, which could also mean missing breakfast. Since I was just out of hospital after a decent week of corona virus infection. I didn’t have the luxury of skipping meals. So I went for breakfast.

                    The moral and ethical compass.

            </div>
            <p class="content">
                Now this was an interesting class. In the start of the class ma’am pulled off an experiment quite nicely. She pretended to slightly angry and gave us a surprise test, in which none of us knew most of the answers and she left the class without invigilating. Some tried to cheat, some were honest. I didn’t try anything because I knew I had absolutely no idea about any of those questions. I suspected that those maybe the topics she taught during the classes where I missed due to corona. This was in fact an experiment to introduce the topic of ethics. Then she showed us a clip of Lance Armstrong’s confession. He was an athlete who won tour de’ france which is considered one of the most cycling competition seven times consecutively. But he had used doping at the time to achieve all those. Later he confessed about it. There was opposing opinions to his confessions. Most of the class was of the opinion that his confession was not genuine, and he was confessing just because he had no other way at that point of time. <br><br> 
                So is it actually wrong to cheat?. Most of the time human beings do an action they don’t think a lot, in fact they just act out of habit. So keeping your consciousness intact is vital. Because when it comes to a point where you have to make a critical decision it is the habit that comes into play. So if you continue to corrupt your consciousness, over time the decisions you take will also be affected. Initially when you try to cut corners you will have high conflict within yourself, but when you start doing it again and again your soul develops a high level of tolerance to it. It is also scientifically documented, the concept of neuroplasticity. Also one more thing to be noted is that, if you cheat and you achieve something, there will be people who would have achieved that without cheating. So you will lose to them anyway. There is also another dilemma that occurs when it comes to ethics. How long can you hold it together when everyone around you is cutting corners. Then it comes to a matter of integrity.

                1.	Identifying the problem statement. <br>
                2.	Analyze the problem from different perspectives so as to get a holistic understanding of the problem<br>
                3.	Get information about the problem <br>
                4.	Idea generation : Brainstorm ideas about the problem.<br>
                5.	Choose an idea by weighing each idea.<br>
                6.	Evaluate the idea.<br>
                7.	Implement it.<br>
                8.	Follow up the solution after implementation.<br><br>
                One of the tips given by Mr.Shiva for creative thinking was, when you are trying to solve a problem just drop everything that you take as granted and start from scratch. By doing so you’ll have to think outside the box to come up with a solution.

                We had a simulation on decision making. In the simulation we were supposed to make decisions regarding a product called glucagauge. The product started receiving complaints after it was launched. The primary assumption of the company was that the instructions of usage on the product was unclear and that may have lead to the misuse of the product which in turn resulted in poor results. So we had a choice whether to invest to improve the instructions or to improve the product. After each decision additional details were given and after three or four iterations it was discovered that there was infact an issue with the product itself. The key in this simulation is the decision making. The traps and biases which come into play while decision making and how to go about those. Some of the most common traps are The Anchoring Trap where you get anchored to some pieces of information and that influences your decision making, The Status-Quo trap where people refrain from decisions that perpetuate the status quo, The sunk-cost trap where we try to make decisions which justifies the past choices, The confirming evidence trap where you try to seek evidence to justify your thinking and not take into consideration the whole picture. So how do you overcome such biases, well some of the things that maybe of some help is to <br><br>

            <p class="content">
                Motivation is why we do what we do. And motivation can vary across people, for some people it may be rewards, for some it may love or external force or something else. It can also be internal or external motivation. Internal motivation is when you perform a task because you find it rewarding. Performing the task itself is the reward rather than the desire for some external reward. Other times, you perform tasks because someone else asks you to or rewards you for completing them; this is known as external motivation. But when you start rewarding a person who is internally motivated to perform a certain task, he may lose interest in the task itself. However this does not suggest that external motivation is a bad thing. Its just that external motivation may not be beneficial in all situations. In situations where a person needs to complete a task that they find unpleasant, then external motivation will be helpful. But if he is already motivated to perform that task, then giving external rewards may make him lost interest in the task.<br>
